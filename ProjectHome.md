Sami Says is an application designed to aid visually impaired children tell stories through sound. As an alternative to writing by hand, students are able to use Sami Says to record themselves speaking their stories aloud. All of the controls are implemented through simple keyboard commands and guided by text-to-speech. The students can choose from libraries of sound effects to insert into their story, so that they may better describe the characters and events. Teachers will also be able to choose which sounds the students may use in a story, so that the children must find creative uses for the specific sounds as they write.

Sami Says exposes children to new technology and enables them to develop their creative writing abilities by creating something that would be difficult without this assistive technology.  And they'll have fun, too.
