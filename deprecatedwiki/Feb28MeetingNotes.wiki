#summary Feb 28 Meeting Notes

whee
 * Default "story" is "Create New Story" on stories screen
 * Change "Create" to "Add a Student"
 * Look into Flight for dynamic TTS sound files
 * Take advantage of recorder - teacher recorded sounds aren't a bad idea for categories, etc.
 * Background audio as context (quiet but not *too* subtle)
 * Use Focus to control what gets events/key input.  Can avoid using Event.Skip to "kill" an event (in HTS, code in event handlers in buttons to shift focus.  can also generate an event when you lose focus to recover it)
