= Design Principles =

 * The GUI should be manageable by novice users.  This entails as few buttons as possible with descriptive labels.  Additionally, tooltips should be included for teachers/parents for every major function to provide a good description of what everything does.

 * No more than six buttons should be used to navigate through the audio interface.  Buttons should perform in a consistent, predictable fashion at all times.

 * It is expected that the teacher will be launching the program and navigate to story creation.  It is also expected that the teacher will either not be visually impaired or be capable of navigating through a GUI with JAWS.

 * It is expected that the students creating stories may be visually impaired, so the interface is designed to accomodate their needs using audio prompts.

 * All interactions should be designed with a novice computer user in mind.  File interactions, such as when a user imports a sound library, should be simple and not assume any knowledge or understanding of directory structure or other advanced topics.

 * The entire program should be kept simple - avoid "modes" and heavy modularization of the design.

 * Two uses should be kept in mind throughout design - "free" and "guided" use.  While the primary purpose is educational with the classroom in mind, users should be able to play on their own without any hassle introduced by managing multiple student profiles.
