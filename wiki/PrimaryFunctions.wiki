= What Sami Says Should Do at a High Level =
  * Provide an easy-to-use, accessible interface for vision-impaired children to record story segments, insert sound clips, and play back completed stories.
  * Provide advanced users an interface for editing their stories and applying more complex audio transformations and filters.
  * Users should be able to extend the built-in sound library to add functionality to the story creation.  For example, a teacher could download a reptile sound library when teaching a lesson on reptiles.
